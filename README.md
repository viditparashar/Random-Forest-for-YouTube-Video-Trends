## Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the factors influencing YouTube video viewership. It involves data scraping, preprocessing, feature extraction, and building a predictive model with an RÂ² score of 0.94 on the test set. There are 3 .ipynb files, FileOne and FileTwo contain a different approach and Final has the final model and output. R2, MAE, and MSE are used for metrics.

## Features
- Scraped video data using the YouTube API.
- Preprocessed text data using NLTK and Googletrans for translation.
- Extracted features with Sentence Transformers, TF-IDF, and sentiment analysis (TextBlob).
- Tried many models, XGBoost, CATBoost, LightGBM, RandomForrest was the best.
- Built a Random Forest Regressor and optimized it using GridSearchCV.
- Explained predictions with SHAP and LIME.
- Visualized insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib, with PCA for dimensionality reduction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, NLTK, TextBlob, SentenceTransformer, scikit-learn, SHAP, LIME, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **APIs**: YouTube Data API
